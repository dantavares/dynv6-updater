# dynv6-updater

A simple graphic app to update your dynv6 ddns on Windows or Linux

Use **powershell-ver** on Windows only or **python-ver** on Windows or Linux

## Working
After running the script, an update icon will appear in your system tray, hover over it and you will see the name "DynV6 Updater". Click on this icon with the right button, and you will see the possible options, which are self explanatory: Show Status, Sync Now and Exit. If you've come this far, you're smart enough to understand what they do.
